# JSciLearn
This is a simple **machine learning** library that written in **Java**. Today the best scientific and machine learning related libraries are written in Python. Altough Python is very clean and powerful for that purposes, libraries that written in Java would be very helpful. I'll be trying to keep this library very neat as possible as it can be. Pure Java libraries, no extra jars.

### Prerequisites

* Java knowledge
* Java Compiler

### Folder Structure

Tried to implement [Maven Folder Structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)

- **bin**
    - *jscilearnml*
        - Compiled class files
    - Workspace.class (class that contain main method)
- **datasets**
    - Sample CSV files
- **src**
    - *main*
        - *java*
            - *jscilearnml*
                - Machine learning library java files
            - Workspace.java

### Installing

You can copy Java files in **src/main/java/jscilearnml** package into your Java or Android project. It can be compiled by using javac or IDE without any additional Java library requirements.

### Current Machine Learning Algorithms

* K Nearest Neighbors *(Simple version. K assumed as 1)*
